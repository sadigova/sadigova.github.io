I am a current PhD student at Kingâ€™s College London and belong to SMAL (Software Modelling and Applied Logic) group, which studies modelling and engineering of software systems, and applications of logic and mathematics to computer science, artificial intelligence, information and software security, and multi-agent systems. 

The tentative title of my thesis is 'Formal Analysis of Human Behaviour in Cyber Security and Digital Forensics'. The project encompasses three main themes: cyber security, digital forensics and HCI.
